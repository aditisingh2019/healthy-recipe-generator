# Healthy Recipe Generator

Hello! This project is a healthy recipe generator. You put in the name of a food, such as pizza or cookies, and this web application will provide you with healthy recipes for this food item. There are also additional options you can specify for your recipes, such as low sugar, low sodium, and high protein. We created this project as a resource for those trying to make a healthy change in their food choices. A problem with several modern diets is that people are forced to give up their favorite foods. We wanted to create a resource that allows people to find healthier versions of their favorite foods to prevent this.

To achieve this, we coded our backend with Python using the Django framework. We are using [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/healthy-diet-recipes-a-comprehensive-dataset) to pull recipes from. The dataset includes macronutrients for every recipe, which is how we added the additional specification functionality. For the frontend, we used React JS to create a clean user interface.
